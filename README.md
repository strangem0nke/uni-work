# uni-work
University assignments

Mainly for archival purposes, but also makes it far easier for me to keep things synced up

COS30008 - Data Structures and Patterns - Mainly just C++

COS30043 - Interface Design and Development - Mostly just the source code for this unit, which is mainly HTML/CSS/JS

Most of the content in the Interface Design class will be uploaded on a separate repository as well as on here, mainly as I've enabled pages on there.
